Dun Game is an experimental project build by myself and a friend.
The Idea was to create a rouge-like dungeon game.
The core idea is that instead of progressing thoriugh 'Levels', after defeating enemies, more rooms open up.
Conceptualy the game world would infinitely expand until the player were to die.
